### Hi there 👋👋 I'm Pasindu. A 2nd-year undergraduate in the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka.

-🌱 I’m currently learning and/or refreshing my knowledge on Data structures, Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming in C++ and Python as well as some Machine Learning and whatever possible. 😂

-📈 After the graduation, I would like to join the industry and apply what I have already learnt to solve real world problems while developing myself through exploring new areas of interest.😎 Because I believe in applying rather than keep learning all the shits in the world.

-💬 Ask me about anything here. If it is something I know, I can help you! 😉
