### Hi there 👋, my name is Arturs
#### I am GitHub Readme Generator's creator
![I am GitHub Readme Generator's creator](🌱 I’m currently learning and/or refreshing my knowledge on Data structures, Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming in C++ and Python as well as some Machine Learning and whatever possible. 😂 📈 After the graduation, I would like to join the industry and apply what I have already learnt to solve real world problems while developing myself through exploring new areas of interest.😎 Because I believe in applying rather than keep learning all the shits in the world. 💬 Ask me about anything here. If it is something I know, I can help you! 😉)

I made this project just for fun, it allows you to create nice and simple GitHub Readme files that you can copy/paste and use in your profile.

Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- 🔭 I’m currently working on this page.
